The background story
--------------------

So my son loves to go to one particular Thai restaurant and order the same dish -- always.  F-11.  That dish and no other.  But as a family we like to try other Thai restaurants.  Of course my son wants to order the same dish.  The problem is, we have have no idea how to order it: none of us speak Thai, and so none of us remember the name of the dish except for the alphanumeric sequence "F-11", which, unfortunately, does not travel well from restaurant to restaurant.

Pretty much everybody has encountered this problem, whether with Thai food, Chinese food, Vietnamese food, or what have you.  Typically it's an issue with cuisine from far eastern cultures whose scripts differ markedly from the Roman script.  I'd like to design an app that assists the user in recording a particular dish in a particular restaurant, finding out what it might be called in a different restaurant, and saving that information in a way that can be conveniently accessed later (the next time the user goes out to eat).

The basics
----------

The basic app needs the following functionality:

* Input in various scripts (minimally Roman, additionally Chinese and Japanese, etc.);
* Ability to store name of dish, brief description, and code/name as encountered in a given restaurant the user has visited;
* Look-up by
    * Name
    * Code
    * Keyword
    * Restaurant

The next phase would be to help the user input the information by searching for

* The particular restaurant's menu online and auto-filling data;
* Dishes similar to the one stored in the data base.

That stuff will be a little harder to come by, since there's probably no standard for the format of such information online.  But perhaps I can at least find a database for some common dishes.  Come to think of it, let's search...

... time passes...

Well, a quick search at least pops up this [Chinese food database](http://chinacuisine.blogspot.com/).  It seems that data bases of other types of cuisine will be harder to come by.  That at least gives me heart: perhaps this is a good app to work on.  The drawback: perhaps it's not the best *first* app to work on.  I guess there's only one way to find out...

Comments and suggestions welcome!

More riveting ideas to come...
