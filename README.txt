The background story
--------------------

So my son loves to go to one particular Thai restaurant and order the same dish -- always.  F-11.  That dish and no other.  But a a family we like to try other Thai restaurants.  Of course my son wants to order the same dish.  The problem is, we have have no idea how to order it: none of us speak Thai, and so none of us remember the name of the dish except for the alphanumeric sequence "F-11", which, unfortunately, does not travel well from restaurant to restaurant.

Pretty much everybody has encountered this problem, whether with Thai food, Chinese food, Vietnamese food, what have you.  Typically it's an issue with cuisine from far eastern cultures whose scripts differ markedly from the Roman script.  I'd like to design an app that assists the user in recording a particular dish in a particular restaurant, finding out what it might be called outside that restaurant, and saving that information in a way that can be conveniently accessed later (the next time the user goes out to eat).

The basics
----------

The basic app needs the following functionality:
*   Input in various scripts (minimally Roman, additionally Chinese and Japanese, etc.);
*   Ability to store name of dish, brief description, and code/name as encountered in a given restaurant the user has visited;
*   Look-up by
**  Name
**  Code
**  Keyword
**  Restaurant

The next phase would be to help the user input the information by searching for
*   The particular restaurant's menu on-line and auto-filling data;
*   Similar dishes to the one stored in the data base.
